_Add new parts and mechanicsüöÄ_

## **About this mod**
Moreparts adds new parts and mechanics to the game. Next, each improvement that this mod adds will be detailed as a tutorial.

### **Coloniesüë©‚ÄçüöÄüë®‚ÄçüöÄ**
`Colonies` are new buildings that you can create on any planet in the solar system. `Colonies` are made up of different buildings that add benefits to the player. Each building is detailed below:

- `Colony Base`: This building is the main base of the colonies.
  - Materials
    - 7 Tons of `construction Material`
    - 7 tons of `electronic components`
  - Building
    - When landing on a planet, the `Create colony` button will be enabled. press the button and the resources of the rocket will be reduced and the `colony` will appear

- `Refinery`: The `refinery` will allow you to recharge your rocket fuel.
  - Materials
    - 12 Tons of `construction Material`
    - 10 tons of `electronic components`
  - Building
    - When you are near the colony you can press `U` to open a colony window. This window shows a button for each building that can be created, so to create a `refinery` you have to press `refinery` button.

### **ARPANETüì°**
The `ARPANET` is the name of the constellation of satellites that you can create to control your rockets. This game mechanic is optional and can only be activated by implementing the `Telecommunication dish` part on your rocket.

Once the antenna is implemented in the rocket it is necessary to activate it, for this it is necessary to press the letter `Y`. Once activated, the antenna will connect to the `space center antenna` and allow the rocket to be controlled.

Once the rocket is in orbit, it needs to have a connection to the space center antenna. This connection can occur directly or indirectly.

### **Custom PartsüÜï**
Also some new parts are added to the game. Some of them are listed below:

- `Balloon`: This part adds a `balloon` to the game that allows you to lift objects without the need for motors. The thrust force of the balloon is calculated by the atmospheric density, so in an environment with low atmospheric density, the thrust force is less.

- `Piston`: It is a simple piece that is used to push things.

- `Cargo parts`: These parts are used to transport materials used to create `colonies`.
